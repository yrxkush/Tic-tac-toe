This tic tak toe game is made in c language using the loops and if else ladder 
I use computer algorithm to not let user win (the algorithm check every row and coloum with 3 conditions, the first and main priority move is to quire the middile position and if none of condition is 
satisfied then it move at the first empty space)  
#continuosly working to optimise and fix errors in the code and providing new code version files in which we use function calling and more........
